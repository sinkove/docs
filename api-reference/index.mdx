## Welcome to Sinkove API

Sinkove's REST API provides programmatic access to our synthetic medical imaging platform. Use our API to create, manage, and download synthetic datasets for your research and development needs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.sinkove.com
```

## Authentication

Sinkove API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  You can generate API keys from your [profile settings](/api-keys). Keep your
  API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard Tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Premium Tier**: 500 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits available

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets

## Response Format

All API responses use JSON format with consistent structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Detailed error description",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

## Common Error Codes

| Code                   | Description                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `INVALID_API_KEY`      | API key is missing or invalid       |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`  | Too many requests, slow down        |
| `DATASET_NOT_FOUND`    | Requested dataset does not exist    |
| `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` | Account lacks credits for operation |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR`     | Request parameters are invalid      |

## SDKs and Libraries

While you can use the REST API directly, we recommend our official SDKs:

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```bash
# List your datasets
curl -X GET "https://api.sinkove.com/v1/datasets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python
# Using Python SDK
import sinkove as sk

client = sk.client("YOUR_API_KEY")
datasets = client.list_datasets()
print(f"You have {len(datasets)} datasets")
```

## API Versioning

The current API version is `v1`. All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/`:

```
GET /v1/datasets
POST /v1/datasets
GET /v1/datasets/{id}
```

We maintain backward compatibility and will provide advance notice of any breaking changes.
