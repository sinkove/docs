## Creating a Synthetic Dataset

Follow these simple steps to generate your synthetic dataset using Sinkove's platform:

### Step 1: Select Model

Navigate to the **Generator** tab and choose a suitable generative model from the dropdown menu. Our models are optimized for different types of medical imaging scenarios.

<Note>
  Different models may specialize in specific imaging modalities or medical
  conditions. Choose the one that best fits your research requirements.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure Dataset

Fill in the provided fields with the details of the medical images you wish to generate:

- **Prompts/Descriptions**: Enter relevant medical descriptions (e.g., "Severe cardiomegaly", "Normal chest X-ray")
- **Dataset Size**: Currently limited to approximately 1000 images
- **Additional Parameters**: Configure any model-specific settings as needed

<Tip>
  Use specific, clinical terminology in your prompts for the most accurate
  synthetic image generation.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Generate Data

You have two options for data generation:

#### Preview Generation

- Click **Generate sample** to preview a single synthetic image
- Review the quality and adjust parameters if needed
- This helps ensure the output matches your expectations

#### Full Dataset Generation

- Set your desired dataset size (up to ~1000 images)
- Click **Generate dataset** to initiate full dataset generation
- Monitor the progress in your dashboard

<Warning>
  Dataset generation may take several minutes to hours depending on the size and
  complexity of your request.
</Warning>

## Downloading Your Dataset

Once your dataset is ready, use our Python SDK for quick and efficient downloading:

```python
import sinkove as sk
import time

# Initialize the client with your API key
my_sk = sk.client("your_API_KEY")

# Replace with your actual dataset ID
dataset = my_sk.dataset("dataset_id_here")

# Wait for dataset to be ready
while not dataset.ready():
    print("Dataset not ready, waiting...")
    time.sleep(10)

# Download the dataset
dataset.save("./dataset.zip")
print("Dataset downloaded successfully!")
```
