## Overview

Sinkove datasets contain synthetically generated medical images created using advanced diffusion models. Each dataset is customizable and designed for research, AI model training, and educational purposes.

## Dataset Types

### Medical Imaging Modalities

Sinkove supports generation of various medical imaging types:

- **Chest X-rays** - Most common modality with multiple specialized models
- **Other Modalities** - Additional imaging types available based on model selection

### Dataset Formats

All datasets are delivered as ZIP archives containing:

- **Images** - High-resolution synthetic medical images (typically 512x512 pixels)
- **Metadata** - JSON files with image annotations and generation parameters
- **Model Cards** - Documentation describing the AI models used for generation

## Creating Datasets

### Configuration Options

When creating a dataset, you can specify:

**Model Selection**

- Choose from available generative models optimized for different scenarios
- Each model may specialize in specific conditions or imaging characteristics

**Prompts and Descriptions**

- Use clinical terminology for accurate generation
- Examples: "Severe cardiomegaly", "Bilateral pneumonia", "Normal chest X-ray"
- Multiple prompts can be used to create diverse datasets

**Dataset Size**

- Currently limited to approximately 1000 images per dataset
- Larger datasets require more generation time

**Quality Settings**

- Configure generation parameters for your specific research needs
- Balance between quality and generation speed

<Tip>
  Start with smaller datasets (10-50 images) to test your configuration before
  generating larger collections.
</Tip>

## Dataset Status Lifecycle

### Status Phases

1. **Pending** - Dataset creation request is queued
2. **Processing** - AI models are actively generating images
3. **Ready** - Dataset is complete and available for download
4. **Failed** - Generation encountered an error
5. **Expired** - Dataset is no longer available (after retention period)

### Monitoring Progress

Track your dataset status through:

- **Web Dashboard** - Real-time status updates in the platform
- **Python SDK** - Programmatic status checking
- **API Endpoints** - Direct REST API status queries

```python
# Check dataset status
dataset = client.dataset("dataset_id")
print(f"Status: {dataset.status}")

# Wait for completion
while not dataset.ready():
    time.sleep(30)
```

## Best Practices

### Research Applications

**Model Training**

- Use diverse prompts to create balanced training sets
- Include both normal and pathological cases
- Consider augmenting real datasets with synthetic data

**Validation Studies**

- Generate datasets with known ground truth for algorithm testing
- Create edge cases that are rare in real clinical data
- Test model robustness with synthetic variations

**Educational Use**

- Create teaching datasets with clear diagnostic features
- Generate rare conditions for student training
- Provide consistent, high-quality examples

### Technical Considerations

**Data Management**

- Download datasets promptly to avoid expiration
- Organize datasets with clear naming conventions
- Maintain metadata for reproducibility

**Quality Assurance**

- Review sample images before generating large datasets
- Validate synthetic images meet your research requirements
- Consider expert review for clinical accuracy

**Ethics and Compliance**

- Use synthetic data responsibly in research contexts
- Clearly label synthetic data in publications
- Follow institutional guidelines for AI-generated content

## Storage and Retention

### Download Requirements

- **Immediate Download** - Download datasets upon completion
- **Retention Period** - Datasets may be automatically deleted after a specified time
- **Storage Limits** - Account storage quotas may apply

### Local Management

```python
# Organize downloaded datasets
import os
from datetime import datetime

def organize_dataset(dataset_id, download_path="./datasets"):
    """Download and organize dataset with timestamp"""

    # Create organized directory structure
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    dataset_dir = os.path.join(download_path, f"{dataset_id}_{timestamp}")
    os.makedirs(dataset_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Download dataset
    dataset = client.dataset(dataset_id)
    if dataset.ready():
        filepath = os.path.join(dataset_dir, "dataset.zip")
        dataset.save(filepath)
        print(f"Dataset saved to: {filepath}")

    return dataset_dir
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Generation Failures**

- Check prompt clarity and clinical accuracy
- Verify model compatibility with requested content
- Reduce dataset size if memory limitations occur

**Download Problems**

- Ensure stable internet connection for large files
- Verify sufficient local storage space
- Check API key permissions

**Quality Issues**

- Refine prompts with more specific medical terminology
- Try different models for better results
- Adjust generation parameters if available
