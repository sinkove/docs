## Overview

API keys provide programmatic access to Sinkove services through our REST API and Python SDK. Use API keys to authenticate requests and automate dataset generation and management workflows.

## Generating API Keys

To create a new API key:

1. **Navigate to Profile**: Log in to your Sinkove account and go to **Profile > API Key**
2. **Generate Key**: Click **Generate Key** to create a new API key
3. **Secure Storage**: Copy and securely store your API key immediately

<Warning>
  API keys provide full access to your Sinkove account. Store them securely and
  never share them publicly or commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

### Python SDK Authentication

```python
import sinkove as sk

# Initialize client with your API key
client = sk.client("your_API_KEY_here")

# Your API key is now ready for use
datasets = client.list_datasets()
```

### REST API Authentication

Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sinkove.com/datasets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_API_KEY_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Tip>
Store your API key in environment variables for better security:

```bash
export SINKOVE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Then reference it in your code:

```python
import os
import sinkove as sk

api_key = os.getenv("SINKOVE_API_KEY")
client = sk.client(api_key)
```

</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in code
- **Rotate Regularly**: Generate new API keys periodically and deactivate old ones
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use separate API keys for different applications when possible

### Usage

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits to ensure reliable service
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage through your dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Invalid API Key Error**

- Verify the API key is copied correctly without extra spaces
- Ensure the API key hasn't been revoked or expired
- Check that you're using the correct authentication format

**Permission Denied**

- Confirm your account has the necessary permissions
- Verify the API key is associated with the correct account
- Contact support if permissions issues persist

### Getting Help

If you experience issues with API key authentication:

- Review the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for authentication details
- Check your account dashboard for API key status
- Contact support at support@sinkove.com for assistance
